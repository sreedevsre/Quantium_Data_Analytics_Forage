## Project Title
# Quantium_Data_Analytics_Forage
This repository showcases the work I did during the Quantium Data Analytics Forage Virtual Internship, where I analyzed customer purchasing behavior, specifically focusing on chip sales. The main aim of the project was to provide strategic recommendations for optimizing category management based on data-driven insights.

Throughout the task, I used Python for data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization to uncover actionable insights about customer segments and their buying patterns. These insights were used to help Julia, the Category Manager, make informed decisions.
