## Project Title
# Quantium_Data_Analytics_Forage
This repository showcases the work I did during the Quantium Data Analytics Forage Virtual Internship, where I analyzed customer purchasing behavior, specifically focusing on chip sales. The main aim of the project was to provide strategic recommendations for optimizing category management based on data-driven insights.

Throughout the task, I used Python for data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization to uncover actionable insights about customer segments and their buying patterns. These insights were used to help Julia, the Category Manager, make informed decisions.

## Key Analysis 
- Data Cleaning & Preparation: Identifying and addressing missing values, outliers, and correcting data formats.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features such as pack size, brand name, and other relevant metrics.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing summary statistics, visualizations, and identifying initial insights into purchasing patterns.
- Sales Revenue Analysis: Analyzing total sales performance across different stores.
- Customer Behavior Insights: Exploring metrics like purchase frequency and customer retention.
- Trial Store Evaluation: Comparing trial stores to control stores using metrics like total sales, number of customers, and purchases per customer.
- Statistical Testing: Assessing the significance of differences in sales between trial and control stores through hypothesis testing.


## Libraries Used
- Jupyter Notebooks: To document and share the analysis interactively.
- Python: The primary programming language used for data manipulation, preprocessing, and statistical analysis.
- Pandas: For handling and transforming data in an easy-to-use format.
- Matplotlib: To create clear and informative visualizations.
- Seaborn: For enhanced data visualization and more advanced statistical plots.
- NumPy: For efficient numerical operations and array handling.
