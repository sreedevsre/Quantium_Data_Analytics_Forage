## Project Title
# Quantium_Data_Analytics_Forage
This repository showcases the work I did during the Quantium Data Analytics Forage Virtual Internship, where I analyzed customer purchasing behavior, specifically focusing on chip sales. The main aim of the project was to provide strategic recommendations for optimizing category management based on data-driven insights.

Throughout the task, I used Python for data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization to uncover actionable insights about customer segments and their buying patterns. These insights were used to help Julia, the Category Manager, make informed decisions.

## Project Overview 
This project focuses on understanding customer behavior related to chip purchases. The goal is to analyze a dataset to identify key customer segments, purchasing trends, and factors that influence chip buying decisions.

1. The analysis includes:
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data cleaning and preprocessing
4. Visualization of key metrics
5. Statistical modeling and hypothesis testing

## Key Analysis Steps 
- Data Cleaning & Preparation: Identifying and addressing missing values, outliers, and correcting data formats.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating new features such as pack size, brand name, and other relevant metrics.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing summary statistics, visualizations, and identifying initial insights into purchasing patterns.
4. Sales Revenue Analysis: Analyzing total sales performance across different stores.
5.Customer Behavior Insights: Exploring metrics like purchase frequency and customer retention.
6. Trial Store Evaluation: Comparing trial stores to control stores using metrics like total sales, number of customers, and purchases per customer.
7. Statistical Testing: Assessing the significance of differences in sales between trial and control stores through hypothesis testing.
